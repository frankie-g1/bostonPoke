# Progress Updates (Oct 29 - Nov 30)

## Week 1 (March 11 - March 15)

### What did your team do last week? 
* Set up repository
* Identify deliverables
* Make plan

### What will you do this week?
* Create UML file to lay out our project
* Designated roles 

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Meetup-times need to be more routine
* Figure out how to 


## Week 2 (March 18 - March 22)

### What did your team do last week?
* We made our UML and divided up the roles as stated previously. Sid will work on all the differet monster classes and the player class.Joey will work mostly on the display, like the map and the battle scenes. Frankie will be working on the trainer class and the battle class.
* We all started working on our separate classes, but have not made much progress, we plan on getting a bulk of the coding done over the weekend and into next week.

...

### What will you do this week?
* Like mentioned previously we will be doing a bulk of our coding this upcoming week. We will also start pushing our codes together into once file rather than working on it separately.
* Edit each other's codes 
* Once we have finished a majority of the coding, we will work as a group to integrate each part into the game itself. We will try to get the game running by the end of the week hopefully.
...

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We don't know how to work with images in java so this is something we will have to learn this upcoming week.
* We are having trouble working in github. This will need to be fixed soon so that we can have access to each other's code.



## Week 3 (March 23 - March 29)

### What did your team do last week?
* We have uploaded all of our files from the local repository to GitHub. All of us have started working on spearate classes, none of us have overwritten eachothers code yet. Sid made alot of progress on the Monster classes for example the constructs and specific methods such as crit chance. Joey started to code for both the Map and Battle classes and Frankie made progress on creating the construct for the enemy Trainer class, which is something that will be instantiated from Joey's battle class. 

...

### What will you do this week?
* This week we plan to finish the majority of our progress making the entire game, our goal is to have all classes and everything set in place before next Friday to ensure that we can polish and debug our game stress-free for the week after. The functionality of the game will be prioritized just as much as the battle portion of the game, for example being able to move to and fro each map portion (scene) and start battles with other trainers.
...

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Main issues are the missing UI or anyway to test our program. We won't be able to see our game's major UI and coding flaws until we have a way to test the controls and actions of the game. Possibly creating a Test class for testing inputs could be implemented to ensure we don't have a buggy mess.


## Week 4 (April 1 - April 5)

### What did your team do last week?
* We have been working on most of the code for the game and integrating them with one another. We are very close to completing most of the code for the game. Sid worked on finishing up trainer and player, Joey started working on the map on which the player will be moving around and interacting with other trainers. Frankie worked on the code for the battle scene. We are working together to integrate our codes into one anothers so they function correctly.

...

### What will you do this week?
* Clean up and finish up our individual code and upload to github. We will then start working on the Game class which will compile all elements of our code together to get the game up and runnning. From there we will clean up code and start debugging enough for the game to run as intended. After that hopefully we will have enough time to start adding more game mechanics and balancing.
...

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* We are still runnning into problems with working with github but we are figuring it out as we go. In terms of code, we are only working on finishing each individual components by ourselves for now but expect to run into challenges when we try to integrate them together into the Game class.
