# Boston-Poke

# **Description**

**What**
We are trying to build a game with a combat system similar to Pokemon, where there are four different types of attacks and we will include 4+ different types of pokemons to use.

**Why**
To have game building experience with object oriented Java and practice with inheritance and polymorphism. Also this will hopefully be entertaining to make and fun to play afterwards.

**How**
So far we have thought to implement a superclass called Pokemon, where say Water Type and Fire Type classes extend to, and have a second subclass which extends the Pokemon types, such as Squirtle and Charizard.
