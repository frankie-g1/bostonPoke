# Boston-Poke

# **Description**

**What**
We built a game losly based on Pokemon, where there are three different types of Pokemon for the user to initially choose from and a map where the user can move around using the keys to battle three diffrent trainers ranging in dificulty. 

**Why**
To have game building experience with object oriented Java and practice with inheritance and polymorphism. Also this will hopefully be entertaining to make and fun to play afterwards.

**How**
So far we have thought to implement a superclass called Pokemon, where say Water Type and Fire Type classes extend to, and have a second subclass which extends the Pokemon types, such as Squirtle and Charizard.
